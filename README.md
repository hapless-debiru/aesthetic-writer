# Aesthetic Writer

Trying to make a distraction-free prose editor with emphasis on aesthetics. The design is inspired by those pimped up screenshots over at [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixpor).

Limitations (rather than features)
----------------------------------

The ones marked as "TODO" are actual issues, the rest can be chalked up to the editor being minimalistic (excuse to save face), which really means me being lazy (the real reason).

- Users can't create or delete files, they can only edit existing ones.
- Users can only edit one file at a time.
- TODO: it could be useful to include a second panel that can be opened and closed, as it could be used to keep notes handy.
- TODO: navigation is clunky, I should look into adding keyboard shortcuts.
- TODO: The back-end is written in PHP for now, ideally it will be rewritten in Node or something.
- TODO: For now it only works on Chrome, and doesn't render as intended on Firefox.
